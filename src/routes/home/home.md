A science gateway is a community-developed set of tools, applications,
and data collections that are integrated via a portal or a suite of applications.
Science gateways provide easy, typically browser-based, access to supercomputers,
software tools, and data repositories to allow researchers to focus on their
scientific goals and less on the cyberinfrastructure. They also foster
collaboration and exchange of ideas among thousands of researchers from multiple
communities.  However, science gateways often leverage only a small subset of the
 NSF-funded cyberinfrastructure to mitigate the complexities involved with using
 multiple resource and services at scale. In response to this need, we are building
 an Automated Monitoring AnalySis Service (AMASS) to leverage systems monitoring data
 so that  science gateways can make job scheduling decisions that increase resource
 usage and minimize the impact of unforeseen software and hardware failures.
 AMASS will be built as a flexible and extensible service based on machine
 learning techniques.  An intuitive query API will be developed and integrated i
 nto the following three target science gateways that will drive the project's
 research and development: the Cyberinfrastructure for Phylogenetic Research (CIPRES),
 the Neuroscience Gateway (NSG), and UltraScan.
